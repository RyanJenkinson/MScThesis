# MScThesis
This repository is for my UCL MSc Thesis: 'Multitask and Meta Learning in Language Models' (CSML 2019)

The code is located in the library `TraMML`: Transformers using Multitask and Meta Learning, which was forked from https://github.com/JenkinsonRyan/TraMML - the github account corresponding to my Streetbees work Github, the company with which the project was in conjunction with.

All thesis files, including thesis.pdf (the final rendered version of the thesis) can be found in `thesis_files/`. We also include all the BibTeX references, papers and images for the readers convenience.

If you are reading this repo - I hope you enjoy!

I'm happy to answer any questions you have if you email me at: ryancjenkinson@gmail.com

Cheers! 

Ryan
